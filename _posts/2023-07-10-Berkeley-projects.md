This section includes machine learning projects during my time in the UC Berkeley Master in Information and Data Science (MIDS) program.

## Brain Tumor Detection
Throughout this project I worked on a team using computer vision concepts to detect if an MRI contained a tumor. We used a dataset of over 4,500 images to construct a convolutional neural network to acheive a recall score of 99%. Shown below is the general architecture of the model used to achieve the described results.
