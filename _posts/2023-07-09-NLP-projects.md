Below are projects using natrual language processing. Subjects range from text classification using a pre-trained BERT model to question aswering and summarization. 

## IMDB Movie Review Classification

This project uses embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model to perform a sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This was accomplished using a BERT model as a baseline, and then passing the learned embeddings to a convolutional neural network for classification. 

## Synonym Detection
In this project I used PySpark to conduct synonym detection on Google's n-gram corpus by using several similarity metrics, such as Overlap, Dice, Cosine, and Jaccard. Due to the size of the corpus, this project relied on optimization strategies such as inverted indices to illistrate co-occurence.
