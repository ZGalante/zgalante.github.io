# IBM 
Throughout my time so far at IBM I've worked on several data science projects on interdisciplinary teams. This includes working with both internal and external stakeholders.

## Outlier Detection
During this project I worked with a major client to design and implement a creative solution to outlier detection. After understanding the client's needs, I explored multiple approaches to outlier detection such as, modified z-score, and inter quartile range.
Due to the client's needs and limitations, I then proposed using the medcouple algorithm for outlier detection. Due to the limited compute resources, the implementation was designed to run in batches. Finally, I led the presentation and training of the implementation
to major internal and external stakeholders.
