Below are projects using natrual language processing. Subjects range from text classification using a pre-trained BERT model to question aswering and summarization. 

## IMDB Movie Review Classification

This project uses embeddings from a pre-trained BERT model to perform a sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This was accomplished using a BERT model as a baseline, and then passing the learned embeddings to a convolutional neural network for classification.
