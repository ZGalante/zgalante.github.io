Included are personal projects that have been submitted to competitions such as the NFL Big Data Bowl and the Horizon Summit. 

## NFL Big Data Bowl

Using a transfer learning approach, this project leverages player tracking data to create an evaluation metric for offensive linemen during the 2021 NFL season. This project required extensive feature engineering to create useful metrics such as bounding box dimensions, and defender tracking to be used in baseline models. Results were then used to train an additonal model to predict the success of a team according to the created metrics, and can be seen in the plot below.
