This section will include a high level overview of projects during my professional career working in data science.

# IBM 
Throughout my time so far at IBM I've worked on several data science projects on interdisciplinary teams. This includes working with both internal and external stakeholders.

## Outlier Detection
During this project I worked with a major client to design and implement a creative solution to outlier detection. After understanding the client's needs, I explored multiple approaches to outlier detection such as, modified z-score, and inter quartile range, where I then proposed using the medcouple algorithm. Due to the limited compute resources, the implementation was designed to run in batches, using an embarrassingly parallel approach. Finally, I led the presentation and training of the implementation to major internal and external stakeholders. 

## Seller's Dashboard
Built using Flask, Plotly, and Pandas, the seller's dashboard is an internal tool used during contract negotiations with clients. I recently took over as the lead developer for the project, having the responsibility of developing new features, and updating each month with current data. To date, the tool has helped to close 4 major renewal negotiations with clients. 

# UC Berkeley School of Information

In addition to my role as a student at UC Berkeley, I am also a Teaching Assistant for the advanced course, [Machine Learning at Scale](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/datasci/261?page=1). In this course, students gain hands on experience implementing machine learning algorithms on large datasets using Apache Spark and Hadoop. In my current role as a Teaching Assistant I focus on assisting students by guiding them through homeworks and providing feedback through grading. In addition, I help refine current material to advance the development of the course.
